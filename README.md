# StackerLang
## All the funnctions that a stack uses are supported: - these functions aren't case sensitive
PUSH 
POP <p></p>
PEEK<p></p>
isEmpty/isFull - True / False<p></p>
SIZE - size of the satck<p></p>


<p></p>
Extra functions:- these functions are case sensitive and must be in all caps<p></p>
STACK - creates a stack object to use <b>MUST BE USED BEFORE USING PUSH / POP</B><p></p>
LOOP/END - used when you want to do a line of code multipule times <p></p>


<p>This program will hopefully help people learn about stacks and interprated langages. I will make a youtube videp explaining all the features and how to run/write the source code for the program
